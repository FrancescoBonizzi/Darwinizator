Darwinizator is an attempt to simulate natural selection within my abstraction.

# Little explanation

Graphically you will se red squares, blue squares and some green dots:
- Red squares represent carnivorous animals that needs to eat herbivor animals
- Blue squares represent herbivore aniumals that needs to eat green dots
- Green dots are plat based food that will spawn randomly at a fixed interval of time

Every animal reacts to the environment and to each other:
- Every animal tend to stay in group
- Every animal will search for food once it is hungry
- Every herbivore will flee if attacked
- Every carnivorous will search for herbivore to eat
- Every animal will try to reproduce
- Every animal will die of old age

# What's the goal?
The goal is to see how this little world behaves and how the population will look like after some times.
In particular, when the animal reproduce, they will generate some random specie traits and I'd like too see which qualities will reproduce more and how far the specie will be compared to the beginning.

# Building
