Darwinizator is an attempt to simulate natural selection within my abstraction.

Graphically you will se red squares, blue squares and some green dots:
- Red squares represent carnivorous animals that needs to eat herbivor animals
- Blue squares represent herbivore aniumals that needs to eat green dots
- Green dots are plat based food that will spawn randomly at a fixed interval of time

Every animal reacts to the environment and to each other:
- Every animal tend to stay in group
- Every animal will search for food once it is hungry
- Every herbivore will flee if attacked
- Every carnivorous will search for herbivore to eat
- Every animal will try to reproduce
- Every animal will die of old age
